## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  

This assignment involves implementing and testing various graph algorithms in C. The program reads a graph from a file, displays its adjacency list, and performs different graph traversal and shortest path algorithms. Specifically, the program includes implementations for Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.


Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

- Read a graph from a file and construct its adjacency list.
- Display the adjacency list of the graph.
- Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from a given vertex.
- Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from a given vertex.
- Find the shortest path from a given vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
